# LibApps
Various pieces of code for the various LibApps

This is my first GitHub repo!

I'm a librarian with a little coding experience (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and some Visual Basic), but I still have much I want to learn.

Collecting my bits and pieces here of Library Front End Web Dev stuff will hopefully make my life a lot easier.
