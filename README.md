# LibApps
Various pieces of code for the various LibApps

This is my first time using GitHub!

I'm a librarian with a little coding experience (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, and some Visual Basic), but I still have a lot to learn.

Collecting my bits and pieces here will hopefully make my life a lot easier.
